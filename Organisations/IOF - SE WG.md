## Meeting Notes

### 210316

input-process-output system
 - not necessary to define input-ptocess-output, as it is not possible to use this to differentitate between types of system
 - if anything, it broadens the scope

Debate re: context
 - do you include the weather?
 - system-of-interest, acts within a larger system, acted on by an operating system

Services:
 - Service is not an output
 - A system that provides a service has no outputs, only inputs
 - As well as this, many different views for different people
 - Here we are leaning towards architecture
 - Service is a capability to provide a process
 - that is not an output
