Overall System Modelling for Systems Engineering

The goal is to develop the [[Space Systems Ontology]] - uses [[OWL]]
Under development by [[MB4SE]] Working Group
 - details of the [[Space Systems Ontology]] provided at link.

Problem Statement
 - Issues associated with [[Standard - ECSS-E-TM-10-23A]]
 - lack of semantic compatibility between suppliers and customers
 - Proven insufficient for one partner to supply a specific view of the data
 - Proven insufficient to apply an excahnge standard that one partner promotes
 - So want to develop OSMoSE - a global space system ontology
		
Ontology Advice - Bolzano
 - "The ontologist needs a tool that checks continuously the ontology at each step of its decvelopment and ensures its overall consistency and quality"
 - "The advice is do not use [[OWL]] as a user, but let tools use OWL for you"
 - "Therefore [[ORM]] is preferred, as it is expressive graphical and concise"
