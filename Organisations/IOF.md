# Industrial Ontology Foundry
led by [[Barry Smith]]
supported by [[NIST]]
One of at least two independent working groups developing open-source SE ontologies - the other is [[ST4SE]]


## Status
registered by April/May (legal entity)
autonomous part of AOGI

## Purpose
Used to generate ontologies for industry - i.e. an industrial version of the biomedical [[OBO Foundry]]

## Collaborations
Collaborating with [[JPL]] on [[OML]]
Also connected to [[SERC]]
Proposals came from these
[[NoMagic]] involved via [[Jim Logan]]
[[Autodesk Toronto]] are involved

## Ontologies
Uses [[BFO]]
Develops MLOs, Common Core Ontologies [[CCO]]

  Need ontological patterns and best practices for:
 granularity levels, and perspectives or viewpoints ("context")
 Relating models, designs and plans about things that don't exist yet in a realist ontology
 
Not looked at M&S in detail, but yes, it needs to fit in
Don't know what the use cases will be yet
 

## Working Groups
[[IOF - SE WG]]
[[IOF - MT Connect WG]]
[[IOF - Interoperability WG]]
No Modelling and Simulation WG yet - but would like to create one

## Problem:
 - Proprietary software never really works well together
 - Consultants can be paid to build custom systems to integrate this software - but this interoperability often fails as these softwares constantly evolve

## Aim:
 - Create a suite of interoprable reference ontologies
 - Benefits: common dictionary with method of maintaining that dictionary over time
 - standardises natural language terms


## Partial Solution:		
[[Ontology|Ontology]] - a common terminological framework based on a stable high-level architecture
e.g. most of the English language never changes, but words evolve at the fringes	
		
But ontologies mostly fail too:
 - Too many ontologies - people think they are easy to build
 - Built in ad hoc ways
 - No common methodology (e.g. for writing definitions)
 - Insufficient long term commitment and funding
 - Poor documentation
 - Poor training

## Solution:
Create a succesful ontology - this must be:
 - Open
 - Robust
 - Global (English)
 - Formalised definitions ([[Semantics]] for computer use)
Then this collection to be used for more granuilar, specific applications	
Then they get the benefit of the logical interoperability	
e.g. the [[Gene Ontology]]

## Choice of TLO
 - [[NIST]] Evaluated BFO against [[DOLCE]] in 43 dimensions
 - [[BFO]] was chosen in 2019
 - DOLCE is based on cultural (e.g. natural language and human common sense, social conventions)
 - BFO tries to build instead on scientific terminology
 - Therefore, there are lots of variants - only one official one (2002)
 - This is not a good approach to ontology - people shouldn't create their own versions.
 - DOLCE has one good application in Hydrology, but others are not so good
 - e.g. developed independently, can't be tracked online, etc.
