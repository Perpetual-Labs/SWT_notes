Industrial Ontology Foundry
led by [[Barry Smith]]
supported by [[NIST]]

Used to generate ontologies for industry - i.e. an industrial version of the biomedical [[OBO Foundry]]

Collaborating with [[JPL]] on [[OML]]
Also connected to [[SERC]]
Proposals came from these

One of at least two independent working groups developing open-source SE ontologies - the other is [[ST4SE]]

Problem:
 - Proprietary software never really works well together
 - Consultants can be paid to build custom systems to integrate this software - but this interoperability often fails as these softwares constantly evolve

Aim:
 - Create a suite of interoprable reference ontologies
 - Benefits: common dictionary with method of maintaining that dictionary over time
 - standardises natural language terms


Partial Solution:		
[[Ontology|Ontology]] - a common terminological framework based on a stable high-level architecture
e.g. most of the English language never changes, but words evolve at the fringes	
		
But ontologies mostly fail too:
 - Too many ontologies - people think they are easy to build
 - Built in ad hoc ways
 - No common methodology (e.g. for writing definitions)
 - Insufficient long term commitment and funding
 - Poor documentation
 - Poor training

Solution:
Create a succesful ontology - this must be:
 - Open
 - Robust
 - Global (English)
 - Formalised definitions ([[Semantics]] for computer use)
Then this collection to be used for more granuilar, specific applications	
Then they get the benefit of the logical interoperability	
e.g. the [[Gene Ontology]]
