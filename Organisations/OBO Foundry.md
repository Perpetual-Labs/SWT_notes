Open Biological and Biomedical [[Ontology|Ontology]] Foundry

note: the industrial version of this is the [[IOF]]
also expanded to:
 - Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)
 - Information Artifact Ontology (IAO)

 - Built around the [[Gene Ontology]] to be used for the whole of biology
 - 90 ontologies
 - 12 are accredited reference ontologies for biology
 - designed to be completely different to [[Linked Open Data (LOD)]]
 - i.e. tightly controlled suite of ontologies and principles for building ontologies in a coordinated way


Hub and Spoke Structure:
 - Modular hub and spoke structure
 - The hub in the middle is the [[BFO]]
 - First group is categories of ontology - e.g. gene ontology, chemistry ontology, etc.
 - Second group is application ontoologies - created by specific research groups, etc. 


Examples of suites of Ontologies:
