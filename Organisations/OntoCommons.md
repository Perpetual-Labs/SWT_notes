# OntoCommons
 - [[Ontology]]-driven data documentation for industry commons
 - Dedicated to **standardisation** of data documentation across all domains related to materials and manufacturing
 - i.e. Produce ISO Standards
 - Produce the [[OCES]]

## Relation to [[IOF]]
OntoCommons is closely related to the IOF Systems Engineering WG - same personnel:
 - [[Jinzhi Lu]]
 - [[Dimitris Kiritsis]]


## Other Relationships
 - not aware or linked to [[OSMOSE]]
 - [[University of Manchester]] are participating


## [[Top Reference Ontology]]:
 - above the [[BFO]]
 - BFO is not the truth! It's one philosophical vision of a [[TLO]]
 - different philosophical visions of ontologies
 - aims to map between multiple TLOs ([[BFO]], [[DOLCE]], [[EMMO]] etc.)
 - enables alignment between TLOs ([[Semantics|semantic]] and [[Syntax|syntactic]] alignment)
 - Consider as a horizontal step to jump between TLOs, rather than a vertical step


## FACTLOG
- real-time procssing layer, sits between digital twin (domain model) and real-time data model (i.e. from observation)


## Problem
 - no standardised tools / methodologies
 - Want to enable intra- and cross-domain interoperability


## Process:
### 1. Community development
 - i.e. engage stakeholders, etc.
### 2. OCES
 - Ontology Commons Ecosystems Toolkit
 - Facilitates development of domain ontologies
 - This focus area will provide a specification and guidelines for the methodological support to industry-targeted ontology development, maintenance and usage for documenting data.
 - Moreover, it will maintain a reference implementation by orchestrating a state-of-the-art toolkit out of systems and services that realise this specification.
### 3. Demonstrators
 - Elevent case studies used already
 - Engaged to have ten more


## Current Focus:
 - Requirements
 - not quality processes (like Gian)


## Languages
 - BFO and IOF, must be in English and [[OWL]], [[FOL]]
 - IOF and OntoCommons will both be compatible with [[OWL2 DL]] (ISO, [[W3C]] standard)
 - Will incorporate processes - discrete and continuous
 - but to have actionable processes - ontology cannot do this - need to transfer to e.g. [[SysML 1]]
 - e.g. the term 'optimisation' is not in the ontology, it is defined later in the tool
 - ontology doesn't capture dynamic so far
 - some examples of trying to capture this other kind of stuff (ICS OWL - French group tries to capture equations)


## Personnel
 - [[Dimitris Kiritsis]]
 - [[Jinzhi Lu]]
 - [[Hedi Karray]]
 - [[Stefano Burgo]]
