The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC)
 - a University-Affiliated Research Center of the US Department of Defense (DoD)
 - leverages the research and expertise of senior lead researchers from 22 collaborator universities throughout the United States.

SERC have defined a lexicon with over 700 categorised terms using authoritative sources (e.g. standards, published literature).

Transformation to a tool-agnostic DE ecosystem will require the ability to:	
 1. Reliably exchange data between multiple forms of tools and media
2. Computationally infer and reason about the data
3. Perform consistency and completeness checks on data
4. Transform the data to needed formats or units

Research conducted at NAVAIR and reported in Blackburn et al has determined that [[Semantic Web|semantic technologies]] will be a key enabler to DE by achieving these four aims.
The success of semantic technology in other fields, like biology, has already demonstrated its ability to advance the practice
