Semantic Technologies for Systems Engineering

Charter:
to promote and champion the development and utilization of ontologies and semantic technologies to support system engineering practice, education, and research.

US equivalent of [[MB4SE]]
SE ontology that uses [[Semantic Web|semantic web technology]]

Organisation include:
 - [[JPL]], [[OpenCAESAR]]
 - [[INCOSE MBSE Patterns WG]]
 - [[OMG]], [[SysML 2.0]]
 - ASME
 - V4 Institute,
 - [[SERC]]

People:
Core Team:
[[Mark Blackburn]]
[[Hans Peter de Koning]]
[[Henson Graves]]
[[Steven Jenkins]]

[[Chris Paredis]]
[[Bill Schindel]]
[[Todd Scneider]]
Additional:

Problem Statement:
 - "Everyone doing their own model" is not sustainable
 - Need repeatable MBSE patterns
 - ST4SE project grows out of INCOSE MBSE Patterns Working Group
 - [[INCOSE MBSE Patterns WG]] intended outcomes - model-based semantic patterns
		
Solution:
 - Develop [[Semantic Web|semantic web technologies]]

Outputs:
 - 2019: A series of MBSE patterns (e.g. System Innovation Pattern
 - 2020: Model Characterisation Pattern (MCP)
 - *added task to read and provide reference*
