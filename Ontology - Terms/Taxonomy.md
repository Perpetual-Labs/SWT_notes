Topic-ontology:
 - Taxonomies that define hierarchies of topics, subjects, categories, or designators.
 - These have a wide range of applications related to classification of different things (entities, information resources, files, Web-pages, etc).
 - The most popular examples are library classification systems and taxonomies, which are widely used in the [[Knowledge Management]] field.
 - Yahoo and DMoz are popular large scale incarnations of this approach.
 - A number of the most popular taxonomies are listed as encoding schemata in [[Dublin Core]];
