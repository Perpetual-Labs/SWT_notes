Useful in [[Description Logics]]
Need to be careful on the implication of this when building an [[Ontology]]

Open-World Assumption
 - Start with an empty DL ontology
 - Constrain the ontology iteratively
 - We cannot entail the negation from the info we have - so assume it is possible
 - i.e OWA assumes incomplete information by default - so under-specification is not a problem.
 - "Absence of information is not negative information"
 - the existence of further individuals is possible

Closed-World Assumption
 - You can't say anything until there is somewhere to say it
 - i.e. anything that cannot be proven to be true, is false
 - the knowledge base contains all individuals
