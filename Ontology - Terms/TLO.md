## Top-Level [[Ontology]]

Contains everything in the universe (in one way or another)
But is structured in a particular way:

Shall include no domain-ontology content
Shall cover all entities

Examples include:
[[BFO]] - [[Stefano Borgo]] view: Monolithic approach
[[DOLCE]] - [[Stefano Borgo]] view: Focussed approach
[[EMMO]] - [[Stefano Borgo]] view: Open approach

[[GFO]]
[[UFO]]
[[TUpper]]
[[YAMATO]]
