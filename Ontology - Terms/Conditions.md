## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions


### Assumptions:

Condition(A) --> Outcome (B)


### Sufficient:

If A then B

Example:
If beheaded then death
(but there are other ways to die, so beheading is not necessary)

### Necessary:

If B then A
If notA then NotB

Example:
if water then we need hydrogen
if we don't have hydrogen, then we don't have water
(but we also need oxygen for water, so hydrogen alone is not sufficient)
