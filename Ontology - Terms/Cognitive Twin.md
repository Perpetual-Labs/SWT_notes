## Definition
Defined by Jinzhi et al in their papers

Cognitive Twin =
[[Digital Twin]]
+Behaviour (i.e. make the Digital Twin actionable)
+[[Knowledge Graph]] (i.e. instantiate the ontology)
Behaviour: decision-making algorithms, real-time processing of data

 - CT can be seen as a DT timestamped through every life cycle phase (evolution of system), and ontology of relationships.
 - CTs are used for dynamic process simulation

## Uses [[BFO]]
i.e:
![[Jinzhi2020 - Knowledge graph modeling for decision-makings in the manufacturing systems.jpg]]

## [[Ontopology]]
Key part is the relationships between the models themselves (ontopology)

e.g. requirements models, decision-making models, etc.
