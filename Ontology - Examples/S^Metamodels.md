Developed by [[INCOSE MBSE Patterns WG]]

S* Metamodel: provides an underlying framework that defines the semantic meaning of models conforming to it. Includes key systems concepts.

S* Pattern: configurable, reusable S^Models. May be an architectural framework. Can be used to rapidly generate S^Models for a given enterprise, product family, or other domain.

S* Model: domain-specific MBSE models based on relevant pattern and therefore the S^Metamodel


S* Patterns and S^Models are independent of any specific modelling language - can be expressed in a variety of languages once a mapping is available (e.g. [[SysML 1]])


Examples:
System of Innovation (SOI) Pattern
Model Charactoierization Pattern (Model Wrapper)
Orbital Satellite Pattern
