# Common Core Ontologies

Created by [[CUBRC]]

## Summary
The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) comprise eleven [[Ontology|ontologies]] that aim to represent and integrate taxonomies of generic classes and relations across all domains of interest.

They are mid-level ontologies ([[MLO]]s), based on the [[BFO]], that can be used to generate domain-specific ontologies.

## Logic
CCOs use Common Logic (basically [[FOL]])
 - OWL Logic is used in the CCO models ([[Description Logics]])
 - They are implemented using [[OWL2 DL]]

Similar structure (hub and spoke) to [[OBO Foundry]]

## Context
![[CCO Context.jpg]]

An unknown domain of discourse is equal to all domains of discourse
(i.e. might need all of them)

Adapted idea from programming languages
i.e. core and common libraries with third-party extensions

Application ontologies make use of multiple CCOs

## List of MLOs
The eleven mid-level ontologies that comprise the Common Core are:
1. Information Entity Ontology
2. Agent Ontology
3. Quality Ontology
4. Event Ontology
5. Artifact Ontology
6. Time Ontology
7. Geospatial Ontology
8. Units of Measure Ontology
9. Currency Unit Ontology
10. Extended Relation Ontology
11. Modal Relation Ontology

Details of each of these are provided throughout the remainder of the [[CUBRC - An Overview of the Common Core Ontologies]] paper.

To date, many domain-level ontologies have been developed based on these mid-level ontologies. Examples include:

1. Affective State Ontology
2. Agent History Ontology
3. Agent Information Ontology
4. Aircraft Ontology
5. Air Force Action Taken Codes Ontology
6. Air Force Aircraft Maintenance Ontology
7. Air Force How-Malfunction Codes Ontology
8. Air Force Maintenance Status Codes Ontology
9. Air Force Type Maintenance Designators Ontology
10. Air Force When-Discovered Codes Ontology
11. Army Universal Task List Ontology
12. Citizenship Ontology
13. Curriculum Ontology
14. Cyber Ontology
15. Ethnicity Ontology
16. Food and Allergy Ontology
17. Food Ontology
18. Hydrographic Feature Ontology
19. Joint Doctrine Ontology
20. Legal and Criminal Act Ontology
21. Maintenance Activity Ontology
22. Medical Information Ontology
23. Military Command and Control Ontology
24. Military Intelligence Ontology
25. Military Occupations Ontology
26. Military Operation Ontology
27. Military Planning Ontology
28. Occupation Ontology
29. Outer Space Ontology
30. Physiographic Feature Ontology
31. Planning Ontology
32. Sensor Ontology
33. Skills Ontology
34. Spacecraft Mission Ontology
35. Spacecraft Ontology
36. Space Event Ontology
37. Space Object Ontology
38. Transportation Infrastructure Ontology
39. Undersea Warfare Ontology
40. Watercraft Ontology
