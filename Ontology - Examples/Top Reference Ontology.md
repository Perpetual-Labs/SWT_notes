## The Top Reference Ontology (TRO) 

is an [[Ontology]] under development by [[OntoCommons]] that will form part of the OntoCommons EcoSystem ([[OCES]]).

It will provide a framework for multiple [[TLO]] and [[MLO]] alignment.
Think of it as a mapping between the TLOs
i.e. it assumes a pluralist approach.

The TRO approach began with the following TLOs:
[[BFO]]
[[DOLCE]]
[[EMMO]]

[[Dov Dori]] made the case at an OntoCommons meeting that [[OPM]] could provide the basis for the TRO
