## DOLCE
[[Ontology]]

It is a [[TLO]] like [[BFO]] and [[EMMO]]

 - DOLCE is based on cultural (e.g. natural language and human common sense, social conventions)
 - Therefore, there are lots of variants - only one official one (2002)
 - This is not a good approach to ontology - people shouldn't create their own versions.
 - It is not well-maintained
 - DOLCE has one good application in Hydrology, but others are not so good
 - e.g. developed independently, can't be tracked online, etc.
