Concurrent Design Platform 4
Developed by [[RHEA Group]]
Compliant to [[Standard - ECSS-E-TM-10-25]]

It is the main engineering tool to support multidisciplinary teams to perform Concurrent Design of complex systems.
Similar in scope to [[Valispace]]

Engineering Models
 - Collaborate on models using implicit modelling. [[Simulation|Execute]] user-defined rules to check the validity of your models. 

Product Tree
 - Use explicit architecture trees of the different design options and see the impact of design changes in real time.

Reference Data Library
 - Use explicit architecture trees of the different design options and see the impact of design changes in real time.

Custom Built-in Rules
 - Build your own [[C]]# built-in rules to check the validity of your models.

[[Python]] Scripting
 - Develop and debug python scripts that can make use of the designed architecture, parameters, and values, and execute them from the desktop application

[[Requirements Engineering]]
 - Create and link requirements to your design for early verification.
