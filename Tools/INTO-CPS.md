Integrated Tool Chain for Model-based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems

Developed by [[Newcastle University]]

 - The tool chain supports the multidisciplinary, collaborative modelling of CPSs from requirements, through design, down to realisation in hardware and software.
 - This enables traceability at all stages of the development.
 - The IP from this project has been transferred to the INTO-CPS Association after the completion of the project.
