# [[Ontology]] White Board

## Features

-   One single [[HTML]] file: works entirely offline with no external dependencies
-   Load/save/drag files in simplified Turtle format with custom prefix mappings
-   Basic editing of named classes, properties and standard literals (string, integer, float)
-   Supports class subsumption and property domains and ranges

Requires .ttl (Turtle) files, rather than .owl
Just save as Turtle syntax in [[Protege]], then manually change the extension
