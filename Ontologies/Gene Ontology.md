The most succesful ontology ever produced.
 - most users, most respected, most up-to-date
 - made data easy to find
 - uses natural language definitions

Initially developed for the Genome Project
Expanded to be used in all fields of Biology and Biomedical sciences.

Contains three threads:
 - Biological Process (What will it do?)
 - Modelcular Function (How does it do it?)
 - Cellular Component (Where is it found?)

This became the basis for the [[BFO]]
