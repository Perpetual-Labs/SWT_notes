[[Ontology|Ontology]] under development by [[MB4SE]] working group as part of the [[OSMOSE]] project

Contributions to Space Systems Ontology:
 - Information to come from Electronic Data Sheet (EDS) - a corpus of space data produced by SAVOIR
 - Data sheet for e-business and business analysis
 - Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks to support production of ontology
 - Requirement Engineering ontology to be included
 - Reverse-engineer the [[ARCADIA]] method	
		
Space Systems Ontology - Key Points
 - [[OWL]] is too low-level from a user perspective
 - [[JPL]] have produced [[OML]] (higher-level) for this purpose
 - [[MB4SE]] Meeting suggest using [[ORM]] - but fragile ORM ecosystem
 - The system engineers, developing the system, will never see the ontology itself - just their usual language
 - Ontology structure: foundation (part of the tooling) + core (skeleton) + domain-specific ontologies
