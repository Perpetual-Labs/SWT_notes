## Modular [[Ontology]] Modeling

Re-use components, not entire ontology
Re-use useful patterns
Relate to other terms, and expand

So woth MOMo, you can load in different [[TLO]]s and [[MLO]]s

Seems perfect for the modular approach to our ontology
i.e. can have user interface in [[CloudSF Tool]] to select modules (and manually mapt classes/relations to the TLO and MLOs) to create custom ontology
