[[Semantics|Semantic]] Repository:
 - formed by datasets together with formal ontologies that define the semantic relationship between the data.
 - a system for storage, querying, and management of structured data with respect to ontologies.
 - At present, there is no single well-established term for such engines weak synonyms are:
	 - [[Reasoning]]
	 - [[Ontology]] server
	 - Metastore
	 - Semantic/triple/[[RDF]] store
	 - Database
	 - Repository
	 - [[Knowledge Base]]
 - Introducing the term ‘semantic repository’ is an attempt to convey the core functionality offered by most of these tools.
 - A Semantic Repository can dynamically interpret metadata schemata and ontologies, which define the structure and the semantics related to the data and the queries.
