# Semantics
The importance of meaning

Semantics: Meaning of language / signs / symbols
 - i.e. How can the meaning of complex concepts be derived from simple concepts based on the rules of syntax?		

[[Syntax]] - comes before semantics
 - Then semantics tells us the meaning of the data based on the syntax			

# Types
Intentional semantics:
- the meaning intended by the user
Formal semantics:
- computer-readable meaning of the symbol sequences
Procedural semantics:
- internal behaviour of the program at execution time
Model-theoretic semantics:
- semantic interpretation of artifical and natural language
- i.e. identifying meaning with an exact and formally defined interretation within a model


Context: Relationship of a concept with the surrounding concepts		
Pragmatics: The intened purpose of the message being communicated		
So, pragmatics is interested in analysing the context to understand the semantics			
Experience: Knowledge of the world (how much information has been put into context)
			
Succesful communication depends on:			
[[Syntax]]: information has to be correctly transmitted / structured		
Semantics: the meaning must be interpreted correctly (understanding) - which depends on:		
 - Pragmatics: the intended message of the sender
 - Context: of both the sender and the receiver - which depends on:
		 - Experience: the knowledge of the world of both sender and receiver
