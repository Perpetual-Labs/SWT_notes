There are limitations with the non-semantic web
(i.e. the web as defined in [[Web History]])
(we want to overcome these with the [[Semantic Web Vision]])

So how do we find information?		
 - Vast amounts of data on web and majority of it is not machine-readable	
 - So what is important and how do we know?
 - e.g.	what is information, and what is advertisement?
 - e.g. what does the information mean?	
 - e.g. how credible / trustworthy is the information?	

The web is based on a markup language language ([[HTML]])
 - Markup languages are only intrerested in formatting and presentation of information	
 - i.e. how it looks, how information is linked, but not what the information means	
So: Main problem
 - info is text-based	
 - not machine interpretable	
 - no representation of any meaning	
Question: What is the meaning??

Specific problems:

Problem 1:	Information retrieval (traditional 'keyword' based search)
e.g. 'Jaguar' - several different meanings - search engine does not know which meaning is meant
1. traditional 'keyword' based search therefore is not efficient (ambiguity, polysemy) - So specify by using latin 'panthera onca'
2. but will only return results with this - not the word 'jaguar', even if in the correct context (synomyms not included)				
					
Problem 2:	Information extraction				
 - e.g. how does a computer extract info from text, or a picture?				
	can only be solves corectly by a human
 - software agent does not have sufficient knowledge of context to solve the problem
 - Humans can derive new information implicitly from old information via logical deduction
 - For a computer, information must be defined explicitly to derive knowledge				
					
Problem 3:	Maintenance
 - The more complex and voluminous a website, the more complicated the maintenance is
 - To maintain semantic and syntactic link consistency				
	e.g. description of link, followed by link itself				
	syntax inconsistency - if the website moves and the link no longer worls			
	semantic inconsistency - if the description says 'links to book', and the link links to movie			
	semanic inconsistencies are really difficult to detect and maintain in a timely way			
					
Problem 4:	Personalisation
 - Adaptation of information content to personal requirements
 - Where does personalised data come from?
 - Balance between personalisation and data security
