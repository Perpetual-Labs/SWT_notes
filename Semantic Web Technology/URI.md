Unique Resource Identifier

Used in the [[Semantic Web]]

Similar to URL (Unique Reference Link) used in web
 - But this links to [[Resources]] (concepts, objects, things) - not documents (i.e. web pages)
 - e.g: people, places, phone numbers, ISBN numbers, buildings, movies, species. etc.
 - Can be the subject or object of a statement
 - Consider this as the web equivalent of moving from documents to models

URI provides two things:
 - Locator: where can the info be found? (might change)
 - Name: persistent identifier (remains unchanged during the lifecycle)
 - If you have the name, you can ask a naming service for the address

Examples of URIs:
 - Web: URL
 - Books: ISBN
 - Papers: DOI

Designator, Designatum:
 - The designator describes an object / concept (the designatum) via metadata
 - Important to distinguish between the object, and its representation via metadata
 - Ceci n'est pas une pipe

URIs are similar to Web page URLs, but do not necessarily identify documents from the Web. For example: 
	- if a particular person owns a web site, authors articles on other sites, gives an interview on another site and has profiles in a couple of social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, then the occurrences of his name/identifier in all these places should be related to exact same identifier.
	- If a particular physical quantity of a system (e.g. temperuature of cooling liquid in an engine) is used in different artefacts in the dataset (e.g. software controlling engine behaviour, termodynamic symulation used for engine design, specification of requirements for temperature sensor, etc.), then the occurrences of this phisical quantity in all these places should be related to the exact same identifier even though a different naming convention is used in the different domains.
