The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud contains:
 - 31 billion facts
 - 500 million links
identified by [[URI]]

![[LOD 2017.jpg]]

e.g. BBCMusic pulls data from [[DBPedia]], and other sources.
Data is available as Linked Open Data
Note: this is not [[Screen-Scraping]]
No manual updating is required

Issues:
 - Aims to link the thousands of ontologies together
 - But still all do it differently
 - [[Ontology|Ontology]] is supposed to solve the problem of terminlogy bloat
 - but looking at Linked Open Data 2017 (in image), doesn't seem to be the case
 - supposed to be a collection of mappings between ontologies - but the mappings never worked
 - mappings not kept up to date between the thousands of ontologies
