# Definitions
Definition 1:
 - The concept of attaching machine understandable metadata to all information published on the internet, so that intelligent agents can consume, combine and process information in an automated fashion.
Definition 2:
 - An extension of the current web in which information is given a well-defined meaning - to enable computers and humans to work better in cooperation. [[Semantics]] are made explicit by formal (structured) and standardised knowledge repreesentations ([[Ontology|ontologies]]) - Tim Berners-Lee, 2001
Definition 3:
 - The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries - [[W3C]] Semantic Web Activity
Definition 4:
 - The set of standards and best practices for sharing data and the semantics of that data for use by applications (i.e. not humans).
These standards are:
 - Specific use of [[Syntax]], i.e:
 - [[RDF]] data model (model not language)
 - [[SPARQL]]
 - [[RDFS]] and [[OWL]] standards
 - Use of [[URI]] to name things
Semantic Web essentially becomes a vast [[Knowledge Graph]]

# Benefits
- To formally represent knowledge about your data
- to relate and integrate heterogeneous data sources
- to process the meaning of information automatically (by machine interpretation)
- to deduce implicite (not evident) information from explicite (evident) information in an automated way
- The intention is to provide information in a structured form so that it can be processed automatically by machines.
- The combination of structured data and inferencing can yield much information not explicitly stated.

# Example
e.g. SkyScanner	
codes and tools that visit other websites and scan useful info	
- web-scraping / screen-scraping
- analyse [[HTML]] web structure of the airlines

# Linked Data
One approach for attaching semantic information to Web content is the use of [[Linked Data]].
 - e.g. [[Linked Open Data (LOD)]]
 - although this is limited
