## Knowledge Representation (KR)
 - about building models.
 - The typical modelling paradigm is mathematical logic, but there are also other approaches, rooted in the information and library science.
 - KR is a very broad term; here we only refer to the mainstream meaning of the world (of a particular state of affairs, situation, domain or problem), which allow for automated reasoning and interpretation
 - [[Ontology|ontologies]] are a type of formal knowledge representation.


## Two types:
 - Logic-based formalisms: difficult to understand (based on [[First Order Logic]], [[Description Logics]])
 - Non logic-based formalisms: closer to human intuition (e.g. semantic networks [[Linked Data]])

## Ontologies and Databases
[[Ontology]]:
 - used to promote interoperability across hetereogenous data systems
 - they do this by promoting the relative stability of natural lenguage
 - ontologies are relatively stable and can be centrally managed
Databases:
 - differ massively form one enterprise to another and change very rapidly in time
