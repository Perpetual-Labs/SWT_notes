Knowledge base (KB):
 - is a broader term than [[Ontology]].
 - is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system. 
 - is similar to an ontology, a KB is represented in a [[Knowledge Representation]] formalism, which allows automatic inference.
 - could include multiple axioms, definitions, rules, facts, statements, and any other primitives.
 - In contrast to ontologies, however, KBs are not intended to represent a shared or consensual conceptualization.
 - Thus, ontologies are a specific sort of a KB.
 - Many KBs can be split into ontology and instance data parts, in a way analogous to the splitting of schemata and concrete data in databases.

In the [[Semantic Web]] sense:
 - KB is a database of both assertions (ground statements) and an inference system for deducing further knowledge based on the structure of the data and a formal vocabulary.
