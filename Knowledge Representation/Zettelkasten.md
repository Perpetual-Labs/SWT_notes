Note-storing Method - German "Slip-box:
 - Consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are acquired.
 - The notes contain metadata to allow the note-taker to associate notes with each other.
 - e.g. notes may contain tags that describe key aspects of the note, and they may cross-reference other notes.
 - Creating and using a Zettelkasten has long been done on paper using index cards.
 - Formalised by  Niklas Luhmann (1927â€“1998) as part of his research into systems theory.

Recent history:
 - Has been implemented in appropriate [[Knowledge Management]] software that make it easier by taking the notes down digitally.
 - This software also enables multiple individuals and teams to collaborative contribute to the same ZettelKasten through the use of Cloud-technologies (Distributed version cotrol, web editors, etc. )
 - The method allows a researcher to store and retrieve information related to their research and intends to enhance creativity.
 - Cross-referencing notes through tags allows the researcher to perceive connections and relationships between individual items of information that may not be apparent in isolation.
 - These emergent aspects of the method make the zettelkasten interpretable as a Graph-like representation of knowledge.
