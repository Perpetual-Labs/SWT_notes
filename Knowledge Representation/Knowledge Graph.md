A Knowledge Graph
 - is a type of [[Knowledge Representation]]
 - is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or topology to integrate data.
 - is often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts – with free-form [[Semantics]]
 - is implemented using a graph data model such as [[RDF]] - Generated from [[RDF]]-based schema 
	 - e.g. [[ESA]] [[ORM]] - based on [[OWL]], which is based on [[RDF]]
	 - e.g. [[JPL]] [[OML]] - based on [[OWL]] as well
 - Can be used to generate structured views - e.g. [[SysML 1]] diagrams
 - Can interrogate model, and structure as necessary
