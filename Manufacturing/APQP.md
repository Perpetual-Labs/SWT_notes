## Advanced Product Quality Planning


### Purpose
Used for introduction of new products and processes
and manage changes to existing products and processes
originally in automotive
now in aerospace, nuclear, etc.

i.e. investment up front to reduce overall cost
 - proactive rather than reactive


### Digital Thread
Consider in context of the three-axis Digital Thread
1. Domains and disciplines (SE, Manufacture, Avionics, etc.)
2. Product Lifecycle (Design, Testing, Operation, Maintenance, etc.)
3. Supply Chain (OEM, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)


### Process
The APQP Process is defined in [[Standard - AS9145]]
[[Standard - AS9145]] also describes the outputs - [[PPAP]]

It is roughly aligned with the SE 'Vee' Model
Plug in ABQP process into existing NPI (e.g. SE) process
don't let it be an island - integrate it
Implement gate reviews in with the SE gate reviews, or perhaps more regularly


### Applicability
AS9145 applies to:
 - new product development
 - products currently in production where changes are planned
 - elected levels of parts (subassemblies)
AS9145 does not apply to:
 - COTS


### Personnel
Necessary personnel
 - need a project owner (i.e. ABQP and PPAP manager)
 - Need a suitable project plan (i.e. timing of APQP activities and developmemt of PPAP items)

Multidisciplinary approach
 - design, purchasing, manufacturing, quality, production, testing, shipping, etc
 - striving for common goal


### Phases
Structures planning for effective NPI into five phases:
1. Planning (project planning and definition, to scope project, timing)
2. Design and development of product (or production design change) is focus activity. Results in product drawing and specifications. Do DFMEA here
3. Design and development of process (Process flow, PFMEA, prelaunch control plan)
4. Validation of product and process (or of changes). Significant test production run. Production Part Approval Process (PPAP). Succesful PPAP means that the project is ready to enter production.
5. Continuous improvement of product and process (e.g. safety, quality, delivery and cost)

### Detailed Phases
1. Planning

Output: The product concept is finalised and a pre-design is available

 [[PPAP]]: 10 (through all five phases)

2. Product design and development

Output: Design record (including authorised changes) and BOM
Design verification and validation plans
Associated verification and validation results
DFMEA, RAMS analysis
Feasibility (of design) - i.e. can it be manufactured, tested, packaged, delivered, etc.

[[PPAP]]: 1, 2

3. Process Design and development

Outputs:
Production process defined and deployed
Succesful completion of the PRR (Production Readiness Review)
Process flow diagram (nominal and alternative processes)
PFMEA
Control Plan (how to control riskd from the two FMEAs)
Packaging, Preservation and Labelling Approvals (based on AS9145 + Customer Requirements)

[[PPAP]]: 3, 4, 5, 8

4. Product and Process Validation

Outputs:
Validation of manufacturing processes
Verification of product against specified requirements
Production Process Run - to validate process and product
Measurement System Analysis - check the devices that validate the process' and product's Key Characteristics (KCs)
Approaved FAIR (First Article Inspection Report)
Approved PPAP

Customer Specific PPAP Requirements
i.e. 11 from AS9145 + company-specific ones
e.g. Rolls Royce has 21 (11+10) PPAP requirements
e.g. UTC has 19 (11+8) PPAP requirements 

[[PPAP]]: 6, 7, 9, 11

5. On-going production, use and post-delivery service

Outputs:
Project closure
Lessons learned
Monitoring of ongoing process


### Benefits

Essentially, high front-end work to anticipate and resolve issues early (proactive, not reactive)
