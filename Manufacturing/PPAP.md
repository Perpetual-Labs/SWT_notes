## Production Part Approval Process

### Purpose
Guarantees that the part being being produced is acceptable and can be shipped to customer

Then, submit PPAP to customer to be signed off
PPAP Approval Form - customer signs off on work
If approved, the organisation is authorised to ship product to the customer.

If product or process is changed after PPAP approval, then a PPAP resubmission is required. The customer has the right to decide what level of risk they are willing to accept.

### APQP and AS9145
The PPAP is the output of the [[APQP]] process
Both APQP and PPAP are defined in the [[Standard - AS9145]]
