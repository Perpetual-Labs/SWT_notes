# Axioms

Details:
 - Axioms are made by putting together [[Classes]], [[Constraints]] and [[Relations]]
 - Axioms describe knowledge that can't be expressed simply with the help of other existing components
 - e.g. it is not possible to lecture two courses at once

When modelling the world:
 - need concepts and relations (i.e. ontology)
 - but also need axioms.
 - e.g:
 - on(X,Y) âˆ§ on(Y,Z) -> above(X,Z)
