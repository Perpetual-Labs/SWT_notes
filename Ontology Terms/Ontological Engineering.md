When building an [[Ontology]], there can be multiple models of the same world.

Therewere we need:

## Ontological Engineering
Ontology Design
 - Methods for efficient development of ontologies
Ontology Mapping
 - Methods for efficient comparison of ontologies
Ontology Merging
 - Methods for efficient merging of ontologies

Need methodologies of ontology deisgn
 - to make consistent
 - to do efficiently
 - to produce distributed development of ontologies
 - Involves: scheduling, control and QA

Ontology engineering: the set of activities that concern the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them

## Steps:
1. Pre-development
	1.	Environment study (software and applications)
	2.	Feasibility study (is it possible?)
2.	Development
	1.	Specification (what is its purpose, stakeholders?)
	2.	Conceptualisation (structure domain knowledge into conceptual model)
	3.	Formalisation (formalise conceptual model - semi-computable)
	4.	Implementation (construction of computable model)
3.	Post-Development
	1.	Maintenance (Update and adjust the ontology)
	2.	Use / Reuse (Use it in planned and unplanned applications)

## Ontology support activities:
 - Knowledge Acquisition (Ontology learning)
 - Evaluation
 - Integration (Ontoloy reuse)
 - Merging
 - Alignment (e.g. mapping rules)
 - Documentation (i.e. of the development process)
 - Configuration Management (of Ontology and documentation)

## Noy Process
(see reference)
1. Determin scope
2. Consider reuse
3. Enumerate terms
4. Define classes
5. Define properties
6. Define constraints (e.g. cardinality, data types)
7. Define axioms
8. Create instances

It is an iterative process - sometimes need to go back
There is no one way to model a domain - there are always viable alternatives
Basically just an application of of the methodology discussed above
