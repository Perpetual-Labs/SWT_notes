from Wikipedia:

Digital Twin:
 - the generation or collection of digital data representing a physical object.
 - The concept of digital twin has its roots in engineering and the creation of engineering drawings/graphics.
 - Digital Twins are the outcome of continuous improvement in the creation of product design and engineering activities.
 - Product drawings and engineering specifications progressed from handmade drafting to computer aided drafting/computer aided design (CAD) to model-based systems engineering [[MBSE]].
