## Reasonable Ontology Templates (OTTR)


### Motivation

Current ontology engineering tools are too low-level.

Makes ontology construction inefficient and error-prone.

Developers end up repeating modelling patterns, as there is nor modelling pattern established in OWL ontologies.


### Approach

Produce a generic structure for adding new classes
(e.g. with a parent, a name and a label)

Essentially write a code to produce the low-level OWL code for you

### Example

### Best Practice

 - Abstractions
 - Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
 - Compositional patterns
 - Encapsulate complexity
 - Uniform modelling
 - Ensure completeness of input
 - Separate design and content
 - Simple input format

 - Substitution
 - Macro expansion
