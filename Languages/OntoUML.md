[[Giancarlo Guizzardo]]

Based on [[UML]]

Distinctions between:
 - 'kind' of thing
 - 'role' of thing
 - 'phase' of thing (intrinsic change, e.g. 'alive' to 'dead')

Can be used to generate [[OWL]] code and open it in [[Protege]]

Create models by instantiating the model pattern

Examples of modularisation (example shows marriage, car rental, car owndership)
i.e. can generate multiple 20-class models out of one large 500-class model, for example.

There is an OntoUML-VP Plugin (to Visual Studio, [[NORMA]]) on [[GitHub]]
