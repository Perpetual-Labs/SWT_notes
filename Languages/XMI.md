## XML Metadata Interchange

XMI is an [[OMG]] standard for exchanging metadata information via [[XML]]

It can be used for any metadata whose metamodel can be expressed in Meta-Object Facility (MOF)

The most common use of XMI is as an interchange format for [[UML]] models, although it can also be used for serialization of models of other languages (metamodels).
