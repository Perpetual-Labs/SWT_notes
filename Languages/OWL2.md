# OWL 2

OWL EL, OWL RL, OWL QL
 - (subsetOf) OWL 2 DL
 - which is a (subsetOf) OWL 2 Full

In this the focus is mainly on OWL 2 DL
 - SHROIQ(D)
 - utilises OWA
 - utilises 'No Unique Name' assumption
 - see [[Description Logics]]
 - [[W3C]] Recommendation since 2009

# OWL 2 DL Overview
The [[Description Logics]] subset of [[OWL]]
 - carefully chosen to balance expressivitiy (i.e. richer [[Semantics]]) with computational complexity of [[Reasoners|reasoning]]
 - In particular, practical reasoning algorithms exist that are both:
	- sound: all inferences drawn are valid
	- complete: all valid inferences are drawn
 - These algorithms have been implemented in both commercial and free software that is widely used
 - In addition, these reasoners can detect various errors such as inconsistencies or unsatisfiable (i.e., overconstrained) classes
 - Information expressed in OWL can be semantically validated
	- We have an opportunity to catch errors on every exchange
