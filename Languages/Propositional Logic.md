In Propositional Logic the world consist simply of facts and nothing else (statements of assertions)
 - i.e. the assignment of truth values to atomic assertions

In Propositional Logic:
 - The world consists of objects and [[Properties]] which distinguish one object from another.
 - There are [[Constraints]] and [[Relations]] between [[Objects]] and some of these Relations are unique, i.e. Functions
 - One problem in PL, it is only possible to make statements about specific objects (not sets or classes). It is difficult to generalise.
 - i.e. Cannot summarise [[Objects]] into [[Classes]]
 - To overcome this limitation [[First Order Logic]] was introduced.

PL uses a set of logical connectives:
 - negation (not) (¬)
 - conjunction (and) (∧)
 - disjunction (or)(∨)
 - implication (if, then) (->)
 - equivalence (if, and only if, then) (↔)

# Examples
PL assertions and deductions:
 - if a then b
 - if it rains, the road will get wet
 - if the moon is made of cheese, then cows can fly
 - If Oliver is in love, then he will be happy
Use of Connectors:
 - Assertions: "The moon is made of green cheese" (g), "It rains" (r), "The street is getting wet" (n)
 - so: if it rains, the street gets wet: r -> n
 - if it rains, and the street soes not get wet, then the moon is made of green cheese: (r ∧ ¬n) -> g
