Systems Modeling Language

derived from [[UML]]

Has [[Syntax]]
Still no logical [[Semantics]]
People customise to own domain (profiles), and focus on [[Syntax]] only
Better to derive DSL directly from [[OML]] instead.


This language was a good start, but is weak in two areas:
 - limited taxonomy of concepts (almost everything is a block)
 - weak semantics: lack of strong logical foundation
Reference [[Jenkins - ST4SE]]

Also:
 - Only recently added execution [[Semantics]]
 - but poor support for logical analyses such as consistency (no contradictions) and satisfiability (no incompatible constraints)
 - Reference [[Elaasar - The Case for Integrated Model-Centric Engineering]]
