An architecture framework establishes a common practice for creating, interpreting, analyzing and using architecture descriptions within a particular domain of application or stakeholder community.

Key aspect of systems engineering, and therefore [[MBSE]]

Can add definitions as necessary:
 - View:
 - Viewpoint:
 - Architecture:
 - Framework:
 - etc

Issue of [[Ontology]]:
 - Difference between SE system decomposition and decomposition for simulation
 - i.e. different stakeholders view system in different ways
 - Essentially, need to cater to different architecture viewpoints
 - e.g. 100 papers - structured by author, date and topic
