Pattern-Based Systems Engineering

Developed by [[INCOSE MBSE Patterns WG]] as part of [[ST4SE]]

Top of pyramid: 'general system pattern' - MBSE [[Ontology|metamodel / ontology]]
Middle of pyramid: application of MBSE ontology to families of systems
Bottom of pyramid: application of ontologies to individual products

The resulting pattern hierarchy is:
Top - general SE pattern [[Semantic Web]]
Middle - minimal system metamodel (e.g. [[S^Metamodels]])
Low middle - system of innovation
Bottom - domain-specific patterns (e.g. flight control pattern)
