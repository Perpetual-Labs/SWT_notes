Aims to address the 6 key aspects of modern SE Practice by doing the following:
 - Adopt linguistic rigour
 - Support decisions with analysis
 - Analyse at the right level of abstraction
 - Define patterns to manage complexity
 - Adopt Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to discover issues early
 - Use content-based CM
 - Use deterministic serialisation of model content
 - Record provenance of model content
 - Define and verify possible invariants
 - Define artifact organisation strategy
 - Account for variation explicitly
