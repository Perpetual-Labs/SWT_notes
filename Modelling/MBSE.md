Systems engineering is inherently a synthetic activity
 - uniting informatiom across multiple disciplines, organisational boundaries, development phases
Agreement on [[Syntax]] and [[Semantics]] for concepts and properties for this disparate information is therefore essential to avoid:
 - unnecessary costs and delays due to work of translation
 - unnecessary risks due to errors in translation

Aspects:
 - [[Requirements Engineering]]
 - [[Simulation]]


DBSE:
 - fosters misunderstanding because of tacit assumptions and implicit [[Semantics]]

MBSE Now:
 - methodologies are not well supported
 - limitations of [[SysML 1]] (as documented)
 - poor support for model fragmentation across domains, disciplines, etc.
 - poor support for model CM (lacks Git-like CM)

MBSE Goal:
 - facilitates precise communication because of standardised [[Semantics]]
 - this goal requires complementing MBSE with a methodology

Tool-specifc solutions need to focus on the high-level methodology / patterns used, rather than low-level discrete model elements (e.g. [[Valispace]]?)
limited / no semantic interoperability across domains


Modern SE Practice - 6 key words:
 - Clarity of communication
 - Rigour through use of mathematical / logical abstractions
- Traceability of decisions, their rationale and the authority context
 - Repeatability - important to formalise complete specification (inputs) of analyses, so they can be repeated easily
 - Durability - related to Repeatability. All information generated (even if outdated) is stored in an accessible location
 - Efficiency - appropriate use of modern computational power to improve automation
 - [[IMCE]] aims to address these


5-10 Year Projection:
 - SE going in the way of [[Semantic Web|semantic web technology]]
 - e.g. Google-style interrogating engine to search the [[Knowledge Graph]]
 - [[Knowledge Graph]] linked to [[SysML 1]] models via APIs - easy to do
