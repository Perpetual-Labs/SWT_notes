CAESAR - Computer-Aided Engineering for System Architecture
 - part of the [[JPL]] [[IMCE]] program
 - Works to realise the reference architecture thats meets the goals of [[IMCE]]
 - Semantic data warehouse for MBSE
 - Ecosystem links authoring tools in and analysis / reporting tools in a natural way to generate reports
 - Auto-generation of reports using a varierty of tools (e.g. Tableau, Tom Sawyer)
 - [[OpenCAESAR]] is open to the public

 - [[OWL]]
 - [[RDF]]
 - Supports query APIs and a query language, [[SPARQL]]
 - Models in [[SysML 1]], then mapped to [[OWL]]
 - Currently preparing for [[SysML 2.0]] - expect cleaner mapping

Tools involved:
